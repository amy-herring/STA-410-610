# Topics of Interest

- General framework of the linear mixed effects model

- Hierarchical models with random intercepts and slopes

- Relaxing assumptions: nonconstant variance

<!--- - Would be good to have an elections case study here too -- pull in Mr. P?  So two case studies for the course -- one on election predictions, and one on hospital rankings?  Maybe election pred is case study but hospital rankings needs to be a series of homework assignments.... --->
