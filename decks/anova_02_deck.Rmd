## Motivating Example: Cycling Safety

In the cycling safety study, after we found evidence that the rider's distance from the curb was related to passing distance (the overall F test), we wanted to learn what kind of relationship existed (pairwise comparisons). Each pairwise comparison is defined by a *linear combination* of the parameters in our model.

Consider the treatment means model $y_{ij}=\mu_j+\varepsilon_{ij}$. We are interested in which $\mu_j\neq\mu_j'$.

## Distribution of Least Squares Estimates

Recall in the linear model, the least squares estimate $\widehat{\beta}=(X'X)^{-1}X'y$. 

Its covariance is given by $\text{Cov}(\widehat{\beta})=\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}$. 

In large samples, or when our errors are exactly normal, $\widehat{\beta} \sim N\left(\beta,\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}\right)$.

## Linear Combinations

In order to test whether the means in group 1 and 2 are the same, we need to test a hypothesis about a *linear combination* of parameters.  

The quantity $\sum_j a_j \mu_j$ is a *linear combination*. It is called a *contrast* if $\sum_j a_j=0$. Using matrix notation, we often express a hypothesis regarding a linear combination of regression coefficients as

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: &\theta& = C\beta = \theta_0 \\
H_a: &\theta& = C\beta \neq \theta_0,
\end{eqnarray*}

where often $\theta_0=0$.

##

For example, if we have three groups and want to test differences in all pairwise comparisons, we can use $\beta=\begin{pmatrix} \mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \\ \mu_3 \end{pmatrix}$, $C=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$, $\theta_0=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ so that our hypothesis is that $\begin{pmatrix} \mu_1 - \mu_2 \\ \mu_1 - \mu_3 \\ \mu_2 - \mu_3 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

## Distributional Results for Linear Combinations

Using basic properties of the multivariate normal distribution, $$C \widehat{\beta} \sim N\left(C\beta,\sigma^2 C(X'X)^{-1}C'\right).$$

Using this result, you can derive the standard error for any linear combination of parameter estimates.

## Multi-Way ANOVA and Interactions

ANOVA is easily extended to accommodate any number of categorical variables. Variables may each contribute independently to a response, or they may work together to influence response values.

*Interaction effects* are important when the association between one independent variable and the response may depend on the level of another independent variable. 
[Click this link for nice insight on what interactions imply in terms of group means](https://courses.washington.edu/smartpsy/interactions.htm)

## Interaction Example

For example, suppose that we are interested in a two-way ANOVA model in which the response $y$ is a measure of headache pain, and the independent variables include the type of pill taken (placebo (j=1) or ibuprofen (j=2)) and the number of pills taken (k=1 or k=2). While we may expect lower pain if multiple ibuprofen pills are taken, we would not expect the same decrease in pain if multiple placebo pills were taken. 


Consider the model $y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}$.

##

$y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}$

In this model,

  - the expected pain level for someone taking 1 placebo pill is $\mu$
  - the expected pain level for someone taking 2 placebo pills is $\mu+\beta$
  - the expected pain level for someone taking 1 ibuprofen pill is $\mu+\alpha$
  - the expected pain level for someone taking 2 ibuprofen pills is $\mu+\alpha+\beta+\gamma$
  
##

$y_{ijk}=\mu + \alpha I(j=2) + \beta I(k=2) + \gamma I(j=k=2)+\varepsilon_{ijk}$

In this model,

  - the expected difference in pain level moving from 1 to 2 ibuprofen pills is $\mu+\alpha - \mu - \alpha - \beta - \gamma$
  - the expected difference in pain level moving from 1 to 2 placebo pills is $\mu - \mu - \beta$
  - the expected drug effect for those taking one pill is $\mu+\alpha-\mu=\alpha$
  - the expected drug effect for those taking two pills is $\mu+\alpha+\beta+\gamma - \mu - \beta=\alpha+\gamma$
  
  
So no interaction ($\gamma=0$) means that the drug effect is the same regardless of the number of pills taken. For there to be no drug effect at all, we need $\gamma=0$ and $\alpha=0$.
