## ANCOVA

ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA -- what's the difference?

##

- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): continuous outcome, categorical predictor(s)
    - one-way ANOVA: one categorical predictor
    - two-way ANOVA: two categorical predictors
    - two-way ANOVA with interaction: you get the picture!
  
- ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance): continuous outcome, categorical predictor(s), at least one continuous predictor that is generally considered a nuisance (not unlike the snout moths, which are often considered pests because they share our tastes in grains)

- MANOVA (Multivariate ANOVA): multiple continuous outcomes, categorical predictor(s)

Historically these names had implications regarding the estimation methods used, but that is no longer always the case.

## data

also we could maybe get the george and rockova data here?

check [data](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoff/Book/Data/data/chapter11.r) -- what is kristian pulling from there -- rmvnorm is it.

## hmm
not liking peter's notes really here. just move straight to lme?
notes8 in my longitudinal class has the MLM formulation of the linear mixed effects model. Maybe pull my 440 notes in here?
