## Motivating Example: Cycling Safety

Dr. Ian Walker at University of Bath carried out a project to investigate how drivers overtake bicyclists. His team modified a bicycle subtly to carry both a video system and an accurate ultrasonic distance sensor that could record the proximities of each passing vehicle.

The team then designed an experiment in which a cyclist (Dr. Walker) varied the distance he rode from the curb (the British spelling kerb is used in the dataset) from 0.25m to 1.25m in 0.25 m increments.
