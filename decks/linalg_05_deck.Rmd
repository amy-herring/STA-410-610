## Gaussian (normal) distribution

A random variable $X$ has a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, written $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, if $X$ has density

\begin{equation*}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2\right\}.
\end{equation*}

When $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$, then we say $X \sim N(0,1)$ has a *standard normal distribution*.  

##

If $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, then $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)$.  For the standard normal distribution, 95\% of the probability mass falls between -1.96 and 1.96 (roughly 2 standard deviations of the mean).  Much of hypothesis testing is based on this fact.

The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean.
