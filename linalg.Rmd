# Learning Objectives

- basic properties of vectors and matrices
- linear independence, dependence, and rank of a matrix
- inversion of full-rank and less than full-rank matrices


# Resources

FIND SOME NICE RESOURCES TO REVIEW LINEAR ALGEBRA; MAYBE AN APPENDIX OF GELMAN OR IS THAT JUST FOR REGRESSION?
