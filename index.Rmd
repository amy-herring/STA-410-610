### Materials

You should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged. Texts and readings will be assigned as needed. The instructor and TA's will support computation in R/RStudio. 

Helpful resource materials for the course include the following.

- Hoff, CSSS - Statistics 560 Lecture notes (Sakai)

- [Gelman and Hill, Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X)


### Topics and Important Dates

STA 410/610 contain a mixture of lecture, lab, and combination sessions at the usual class and lab times. Frequent mini-assessments will be provided in class and lab to check mastery and identify areas for additional focus.

Note: this schedule is approximate and is likely to be modified as the course progresses. Some lab sessions will be swapped with lectures due to instructor travel or course timing. Assignments are due at the beginning of class unless otherwise specified.
